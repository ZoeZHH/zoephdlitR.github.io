## **Deciduous Forests Use Carbon More Efficiently Than Evergreen Forests (Luo et al., 2024)**

Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE) = NPP/GPP = (GPP-Ra)/GPP, a higher CUE
indicates faster accumulation of biomass and production of other
secondary products.

-   Previous studies suggested the global CUE converges to 0.47 (± 0.04)
    with little variation across temperate and boreal forest stands

*R* into growth (*R*~G~) and maintenance (*R*~M~) components, *R*~G~ is
considered to be a fixed fraction of new tissue growth, independent of
temperature, the fraction varying only with the cost of building the
compounds constituting the new tissue. *R*~M~ is the cost of maintaining
the existing biomass (Wlive). Temperature, substrate availability and
the demand for respiratory products are considered to control *R*~M.~

Method: Used GPP and Reco values based on daytime partitioning methods

CUE = (GPP-Ra)/GPP = 1 - Ra/GPP

Between any two timesteps in the case of constant CUE, 𝚫Ra = (1-CUE) \*
𝚫GPP（Equation 1)

With the assumption that plant respiration is proportional to the mass
of plant dry matter, \
Ra = RG+RM = gRG + mRWlive （Equation 2）

Sub Equation 1 to Equation 2: 𝚫Ra = gR𝚫G + mR𝚫Wlive

𝚫G = 𝚫NPP = 𝚫GPP\* CUE

𝚫Wlive = 𝚫cNPP = 𝚫cGPP \* CUE \* (1-τ), **τ** (tau) represents the
fraction of live biomass turned into **non-respiratory biomass per unit
time** (e.g., structural growth, leaf loss, turnover to litter, etc.).

ΔRa = gR×CUE×ΔGPP + mR×CUE×ΔcGPP×(1-τ) (Equation 3)

Step 1 - mR has strong temperature dependence and changes substantially
within a year, include temperature sensitivity into equation

Step 2 - grouped flux observations using windows of 5 consecutive days
in the growing season -\> assumes there are limited changes in the
biomass of leaf and ne roots within the short time window

Step 3 - group flux observations by daily mean T (difference less
than 1) and remove days with rainfall greater than 2 mm/day to avoid
sudden pulses of respiration after rewetting the soil

-\> Limited changes in soil organic matter and no changes in Rh under
similar T -\> ΔRa = ΔReco

ΔReco = gR×CUE×ΔGPP + e\^(-Ea/KB)(1/T-1/T0) ×mR0×CUE×ΔcGPP× (1-τ)
(Equation 4)

## **Forest Production Efficiency Increases with Growth Temperature (Collalti et al., 2020)**

Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE) = NPP/GPP

Biomass Production Efficiency (BPE) = BP/GPP

-   Biomass production (BP), how organic carbon is partitioned into
    plant organs versus other less stable forms which include soluble
    organic compounds exuded to the rhizosphere or stored as reserves,
    and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted to the
    atmosphere
