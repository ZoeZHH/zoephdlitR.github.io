Scientists: 1) some authors have defined NEP primarily as net C
accumulation rate

2\) dissolved, volatile, and depositional organic and inorganic C fluxes
other than GPP and ER are often substantial -\> the imbalance between
GPP and ER does not equal next C accumulation rate in ecosystems -\> the
imbalance between GPP and ER

At the end, we think NEP = GPP - ER

NECB as the net rate of C accumulation in ecosystems.

$\text{NECB} = -\text{NEE} + F_{\text{CO}} + F_{\text{CH}4} + F{\text{VOC}} + F_{\text{DIC}} + F_{\text{DOC}} + F_{\text{PC}}$

FCO is net carbon monoxide (CO) absorption (or efflux \[negative
sign\]); FCH4 is net methane (CH4) consumption (or efflux \[negative
sign\]); FVOC is net volatile organic C (VOC) absorption (or efflux
\[negative sign\]); FDIC is net dissolved inorganic C (DIC) input to the
ecosystem (or net DIC leaching loss \[negative sign\]); FDOC is net
dissolved organic C (DOC) input (or net DOC leaching loss \[negative
sign\]); and FPC is the net lateral transfer of particulate
(nondissolved, nongaseous) C into the ecosystem (or out of \[negative
sign\]) by processes such as animal movement, soot emission during
fires, water and wind deposition and erosion, and anthropogenic
transport or harvest.

**NEE is defined by atmospheric scientists as a C input to the
atmosphere, wheres NEP and NECB are defined by ecologists as C inputs to
ecosystems**

GPP 1) = photosynthesis (we only have this when use Eddy Covariance) and
2) = photosynthesis + chemoautotrophy (a process where certain bacteria
and archaea fix carbon dioxide into organic matter using energy from the
oxidation of inorganic compounds instead of sunlight.)

Autotrophic respiration (AR) is the sum of respiration (CO2 production)
by all living parts of primary producers per unit ground or water area
and time.

Heterotrophic respiration (HR) is the respiration rate of heterotrophic
organisms (animals and microbes) summed per unit ground or water area
and time.

Ecosystem respiration (ER) is the respiration of all organisms summed
per unit ground or water area and time.

Net ecosystem production (NEP) is GPP minus ER.

Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is the net CO2 exchange with the
atmosphere—that is, the vertical and lateral CO2 flux from the ecosystem
to the atmosphere (Baldocchi 2003).

Net primary production (NPP) is GPP - AR. It includes not only the
growth of primary producers (biomass accumulation and tissue turnover
above and belowground in terrestrial ecosystems) but also the C transfer
to herbivores and root symbionts (for example, mycorrhizal fungi), the
excretion of organic C from algae, and the production of root exudates
and plant VOCs

Zanotelli D, Montagnani L, Manca G, Tagliavini M (2013) Net primary
productivity, allocation pattern and carbon use efficiency in an apple
orchard assessed by integrating eddy covariance, biometric and
continuous chamber measurements. Biogeosciences 10:3089–3108.

GPP is the balance between carbon fixed through photosynthesis and
carbon lost through photorespiration, expressed per unit ground area and
time

Rubisco also favors oxygenase (so that part of the substrate is also
oxidized, rather than carboxylated); this is a loss of substrate and
waste of energy, i.e., ATP and NADPH break up carbon substrate and
produce CO2. This is called photorespiration and can reduce of 30-50%
net CO2 uptake (it depends on the CO2:O2 concentration).

NPP is GPP minus autotrophic respiration

Biomass production is the part of NPP that is used for biomass growth
(taken to include litter and fruit production). Another part of NPP can
be allocated to organic compounds that are not used for growth,
including non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs; including starch, sugars
and other polysaccharides), labile root exudates (primarily organic
acids) that support biological activity in the rhizosphere and secondary
metabolites (including biogenic volatile organic compounds) that are
involved in signalling, defence against pathogens and herbivores or
protection of tissues against thermal oxidative stress.

Gifford (1995) proposed the term ‘carbon use efficiency’ (CUE = 1 −
Ra/GPP), which is equivalent to the NPP to GPP ratio as defined by W98.

## **Deciduous Forests Use Carbon More Efficiently Than Evergreen Forests (Luo et al., 2024)**

Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE) = NPP/GPP = (GPP-Ra)/GPP, a higher CUE
indicates faster accumulation of biomass and production of other
secondary products.

-   Previous studies suggested the global CUE converges to 0.47 (± 0.04)
    with little variation across temperate and boreal forest stands

*R* into growth (*R*~G~) and maintenance (*R*~M~) components, *R*~G~ is
considered to be a fixed fraction of new tissue growth, independent of
temperature, the fraction varying only with the cost of building the
compounds constituting the new tissue. *R*~M~ is the cost of maintaining
the existing biomass (Wlive). Temperature, substrate availability and
the demand for respiratory products are considered to control *R*~M.~

Method: Used GPP and Reco values based on daytime partitioning methods

CUE = (GPP-Ra)/GPP = 1 - Ra/GPP

Between any two timesteps in the case of constant CUE, 𝚫Ra = (1-CUE) \*
𝚫GPP（Equation 1)

With the assumption that plant respiration is proportional to the mass
of plant dry matter,\
Ra = RG+RM = gRG + mRWlive （Equation 2）

Sub Equation 1 to Equation 2: 𝚫Ra = gR𝚫G + mR𝚫Wlive

𝚫G = 𝚫NPP = 𝚫GPP\* CUE

𝚫Wlive = 𝚫cNPP = 𝚫cGPP \* CUE \* (1-τ), **τ** (tau) represents the
fraction of live biomass turned into non-respiratory biomass per unit
time (e.g., structural growth, leaf loss, turnover to litter, etc.).

ΔRa = gR×CUE×ΔGPP + mR×CUE×ΔcGPP×(1-τ) (Equation 3)

Step 1 - mR has strong temperature dependence and changes substantially
within a year, include temperature sensitivity into equation

Step 2 - grouped flux observations using windows of 5 consecutive days
in the growing season -\> assumes there are limited changes in the
biomass of leaf and ne roots within the short time window

Step 3 - group flux observations by daily mean T (difference less
than 1) and remove days with rainfall greater than 2 mm/day to avoid
sudden pulses of respiration after rewetting the soil

-\> Limited changes in soil organic matter and no changes in Rh under
similar T -\> ΔRa = ΔReco

ΔReco = gR×CUE×ΔGPP + e\^(-Ea/KB)(1/T-1/T0) ×mR0×CUE×ΔcGPP× (1-τ)
(Equation 4)

## **Forest Production Efficiency Increases with Growth Temperature (Collalti et al., 2020)**

Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE) = NPP/GPP

Biomass Production Efficiency (BPE) = BP/GPP

-   Biomass production (BP), how organic carbon is partitioned into
    plant organs versus other less stable forms which include soluble
    organic compounds exuded to the rhizosphere or stored as reserves,
    and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted to the
    atmosphere

## **GRS 2500 WORDS QUICK LEARN**

Kok effect?

In darkness, plant mitochondria respire (release CO₂). In low light,
mitochondria reduce respiration (called *light-inhibited respiration*).
So it *looks* like photosynthesis is less efficient in low light — but
actually, part of the CO₂ that would be released from respiration is
just being suppressed.

## **2025/03/26 Is NPP proportional to GPP? Waring's hypothesis 20 years on (Collalti & Prentice, 2019)**

**This paper reviews progress in understanding the NPP:GPP ratio in
forests during the 20 years since the Waring et al. paper, which found a
NPP:GPP ratio of 0.47 ± 0.04 (SD) is universal across biomes, tree
species and stand ages.**

GPP can be estimated either from remote sensing with light-use
efficiency model at timescale around a week or sub-daily basis with EC
partitioning

Gifford (1995) proposed term 'carbon use efficiency', CUE = NPP/GPP =
1-Ra/GPP\
Vicca et al. (2012) introduced 'biomass production efficiency', BPE =
BP/GPP

**CUE varied across forest types and stand age**

**Cannell (2000)** showed a stable ratio of Ra and GPP, but noted that
assuming a single value in models might overlook both differences among
sites and variations from year to year.\
**Amthor (2000)** analysed 30 years of studies on NPP:GPP, ranged from
0.20 to 0.65, the lowest values for moist tropical forests, and the
highest value for a temperate Fraxinus plantation.\
**Ryan et al. (2004)** found instead that an age-related decline in GPP
was accompanied by a decline in Ra.\
**De Lucia et al. (2007)** the NPP:GPP ratio, largely based on biometric
estimates of BP standing in for NPP, varied substantially among biomes
and age classes.

**Variability across measurement methods**

**Curtis et al. (2005)** compared independent methods to estimate BP and
eddy covariance for GPP, an average NPP:GPP ratio of 0.42 ± 0.016 using
biometric methods for both NPP and GPP and 0.54 ± 0.04 using biometric
methods for NPP against eddy covariance GPP.

## **2025/03/27** Net primary productivity, allocation pattern and carbon use efficiency in an apple orchard assessed by integrating eddy covariance, biometric and continuous chamber measurements (Zanotelli et al., 2013)

**This paper combined three largely deployed methods, eddy covariance,
soil respiration and biometric measurements, to assess monthly values of
CUE, NPP and allocation patterns in different plant organs in an apple
orchard during 2010, with an annual average of 0.71 ± 0.12.**

NPP = GPP-Ra = NEP+Rh

GPP = NPP + Ra = NEP+Reco, Reco =Ra + Rh

Methods:

1\) Eddy Covariance Technique for GPP

2\) Biometric measurements for NPP: NPP (How much has been growth?) =
standing biomass from now - standing biomass from last time + litter
collected in nets

3\) Automatic multichambered fir Rs and Rh (trenched)

Ra can be calculated by 1) Ra = GPP (EC)-NPP (Biometric); 2) Ra = Reco
(EC)- Rh (chamber); 3) Ra_BG = Rs-Rh, Ra = k(Ra_BG) upscaling the Ra_BG
to get Ra

NPP can be calculated by 1) NPP_biom or 2) NPP_flux (NEP from EC+Rh from
chamber)

GPP can be calculated by 1) GPP_EC from EC or GPP_BS = NPP_biom +
upscale Ra

**CUE can be calculated by 1) NPP_biom/GPP_EC (yearly and seasonal), 2)
NPP_flux/GPP_BS (yearly), 3) NPP_flux/GPP_EC & 4) NPP_biom/GPP_BS**

Results: NPPbiom/GPPEC 0.76 ± 0.13 NPPflux/GPPEC 0.79 ±0.14
NPPbiom/GPPBS 0.64 ± 0.10 NPPflux/GPPBS 0.66 ± 0.11

Takeaway: CUE of agro-ecosystems can be higher than that of forests
growing in a similar climate, comes from higher GPP.

Points to explore: CUE is an intuitive and easily comparable index to
assess the capacity of an ecosystem to transfer C from the atmosphere to
terrestrial biomass

? The Eddysoft software uses the algorithm proposed by Eugster and Senn
(1995) to correct for the underestimation of covariance signal due to
damping of high-frequency fluctuation of CO2 concentration.

## **2025/03/28** The proposed of concept CUE, Whole plant respiration and photosynthesis under increased CO2 concentration and Temperature (GIFFORD, 1995)

Gifford (1995) proposed the term ‘carbon use efficiency’ (CUE = 1 −
Ra/GPP), which is equivalent to the NPP to GPP ratio as defined by
Waring et al. (1998).

Discussion about CUE:

CUE = (P-R)/P = 1- R/P, in my finding, I found R/P becomes smaller as
CO2 increase. R increase smaller than P increase

In this paper, Gifford (1995) increased CO2 from ambient to 710 PPM,
found CUE increased from 0.65 to 0.66

## **2025/04/04** Measuring Net Primary Production in Forests: Concepts and Field Methods (Clark et al., 2001)
Purpose: 1) examine how forest NPP (above- and below-ground) can be estimated based on field measurements, 2) assess implications of the limitations of past studies for current perceptions of the amount of NPP in forests globally, 3) how field NPP studies can be used to evaluate tower-based measurements of forest carbon flux

NPP is defined as the total new organic matter produced during a specified interval.

NPP measurements:
Approach one for individual trees measurements: 
stand increment = (sum increments of surviving trees) + (sum increments of ingrowth)
Ingrowth refers to trees that reached the minimum measurable size during the interval, and their NPP contribution is calculated only from that threshold to avoid overestimation.
