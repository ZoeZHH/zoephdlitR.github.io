Vegetation reflects a high amount of NIR (40-60%), absorbs RED (thus reflect less, below 10%) due to chlorophyll. Thus, healthy vegetation has higher NDVI due to high NIR-to-red ratio. Normalization is essential in NDVI to minimize the effects of lighting conditions, sun angle, and atmospheric interference, making vegetation measurements more consistent and comparable across different times and locations. Consider what will happen during a cloudy day vs. sunny day?"
