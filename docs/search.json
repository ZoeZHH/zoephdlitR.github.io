Vegetation reflects a high amount of NIR (40-60%), absorbs RED (thus reflect less, below 10%) due to chlorophyll. Thus, healthy vegetation has higher NDVI due to high NIR-to-red ratio. Normalization is essential in NDVI to minimize the effects of lighting conditions, sun angle, and atmospheric interference, making vegetation measurements more consistent and comparable across different times and locations. Consider what will happen during a cloudy day vs. sunny day?\nNormalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) introduced by Gao in 1996, defined as \\[NDWI = (NIR-SWIR)/(NIR+SWIR) = [\\rho(0.86\\mu m)-\\rho(1.24\\mu m)] / [\\rho(0.86\\mu m)+\\rho(1.24\\mu m)]\\].

How does this research help Singapore? People might not understand the importance of it. Answer: Singapore aims for carbon neutral by 2050. We don’t have knowledge in tropical forests. 2) The concept between accounting C and C fluxes Answer: Savings vs. Investing 3) Water part? How understanding of the watershed monitoring to help? 4) How sites data complement model prediction and validation? 5) The possibility of erecting a high flux tower (&gt;40m might be too high, flight restriction) - Is the proposed site the best site? - Who take control on constructions? NPARKs+VCA+EIA - Forest site is hard. Think about existing tower. 6) Rationale for grassland site?

Based on a review of in situ measurements, the Q10 value for total soil respiration has a median value of 2.4.\nThe turnover time of soil carbon refers to the average time that carbon remains in the soil before being released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide through decomposition. = soil carbon pool / soil respiration rate from the decomposition of soil organic matter (if with assumption live root contribute 30%, then you get soil R * 0.70 for soil organic matter decomposition)\nDiscussion: Ecosystem respiration, collar heights"

Van’t Hoff observed that the rate of chemical reactions changes exponentially with temperature. And the derivative of it in linear relationship. \\[\\frac{d(\\ln k)}{dT} = \\frac{E}{\\mathcal{R}T^2} + c\\]\n1889 Arrhenius built on van’t Hoff’s observations and incorporated the concept of energy distribution among reacting molecules (based on Boltzmann’s statistical mechanics). He simplified van’t Hoff’s equation by assuming c=0 and integrating it into a simpler form to explain reaction kinetics.\n\\[k = d e^{-\\frac{E}{\\mathcal{R}T}}\\]\nWhere d is a constant, E is activation energy, T is the absolute temperature (K). But we would like to involve a reference temperature (283.15K), where standardize the temperature dependencies (enables consistent comparisons across data sets, standardizing variation between ecosystems).\n\\[R = R_{10} e^{\\frac{E}{\\mathcal{R} \\cdot 283.15} \\left(1 - \\frac{283.15}{T}\\right)}\\]\nSoil respiration involves changing populations of many different organisms, each undergoing a complex series of reactions, which is likely that the activation energies may indeed increase with decreasing temperature. Kavanau (1951) utilized kinetic theory to derive a semi-empirical formulation that effectively gives a decrease in activation energy with increasing temperature.\n\\[k_R = P \\left[1 - e^{-\\frac{E_0}{T - T_0}}\\right]\\]\nA simplified version:\n\\[\nR = A e^{-\\frac{E_0}{T - T_0}}\n\\]\nFinal form relative to 10 celsius degree by Lloyd & Taylor, 1994:\n\\[R_{\\text{eco}}(T) = R_{\\text{eco,ref}} e^{E_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{Ref}} - T_0} - \\frac{1}{T - T_0} \\right)}\\]\nThis equation indeed used to calculate Reco at night for nighttime partitioning method.\n1898 Q10: Van’t Hoff in 1898 (p226-228) observed from the data he collected for T (temperature) vs k (reaction rate constant), for many chemical reactions, the k typically increases by a factor of 2 to 3 for every 10°C increase in temperature [T VS. Reaction Rates]. This is in exponential relationship. To further test if reaction rates are in certain times for 10°C intervals, we used: \\(log_{10}k = a +bt\\) & \\((k_{t+10})/k_t = 10^{10b}\\)\nThis make us available to calculate any ratios, such as for ethyl acetate: 9.4°C k=2.307 & 44.94°C k=21.648, sub to \\(log_{10}k = a +bt\\), we are able to calculate b and then \\(10^{10b}\\) to get the ratios.\nThe idea posted by Van’t Hoff was further widely used in ecology study."

Which expresses reaction rate as a hyperbolic function:\n\\[v = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m + [S]}\\]\nwhere \\(V_{max}\\)​ is the maximum rate, [S] is the substrate concentration, and \\(K_m\\)​ is the Michaelis constant (substrate concentration at half-maximum rate).\nRectangular hyperbolic light-response curve (Falge et al., 2001)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\mathrm{NEE} = \\frac{\\alpha \\beta R_g}{\\alpha R_g + \\beta} + \\gamma\\end{equation}\\]\n\\(\\alpha \\, (\\mu\\text{mol C J}^{-1})\\) is the canopy light utilization efficiency and represents the initial slope of the light–response curve\n\\(\\beta \\, (\\mu\\text{mol C m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1})\\) is the maximum CO2 uptake rate of the canopy at light saturation\n\\(\\gamma \\, (\\mu\\text{mol C m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1})\\) is the ecosystem respiration\n\\(R_g \\, ({W m}^{-2})\\) is the global radiation\nGilmanov et al. (2003) consider the temperature sensitivity of the Reco, thus combined with Llyod & Taylor (1994), then:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\mathrm{NEE} = \\frac{\\alpha \\beta R_g}{\\alpha R_g + \\beta} + R_{\\text{eco,ref}} e^{E_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{Ref}} - T_0} - \\frac{1}{T - T_0} \\right)}\\end{equation}\\]\nThere are two ways in estimating parameters:\na) E0 was estimated using nighttime data, Reco,ref, alpha, beta were derived from daytime data ; b) All parameters were estimated using daytime data.\nWith the consideration of VPD limitation, β could be further interpreted as with an exponential decreasing function (Korner, 1995)\n\\[\n\\beta =\\begin{cases} \\beta_0 \\exp(-k(\\text{VPD} - \\text{VPD}_0)), & \\text{VPD} &gt; \\text{VPD}_0, \\\\\\beta_0, & \\text{VPD} \\leq \\text{VPD}_0.\\end{cases}\n\\]"

    "text": "Widespread inhibition of daytime ecosystem respiration (Keenan et al., 2019)\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0809-2#ref-CR12 With the consideration of the inhibition of leaf respiration in the light\nThe daytime and nighttime approaches are built on the assumption that the reference respiration rate (Rref) does not change between night and day. If there’s inhibition of leaf respiration in the light, then nighttime method will overestimate daytime respiration and the daytime method will underestimate the nighttime respiration\nHere, modified both the standard daytime and night-time partitioning methods to account for an apparent inhibition by estimating and applying Rref nighttime and Rref daytime separately."
