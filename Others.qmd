2024/11/11 Proposal Questions Record: Long-term monitoring of element
cycles and surface energy budgets in tropical urban and natural
ecosystems in Singapore 1) Interdisciplinary. How does this research
help Singapore? People might not understand the importance of it.
Answer: Singapore aims for carbon neutral by 2050. We donâ€™t have
knowledge in tropical forests. 2) The concept between accounting C and C
fluxes Answer: Savings vs. Investing 3) Water part? How understanding of
the watershed monitoring to help? 4) How sites data complement model
prediction and validation? 5) The possibility of erecting a high flux
tower (\>40m might be too high, flight restriction) - Is the proposed
site the best site? - Who take control on constructions?
NPARKs+VCA+EIA - Forest site is hard. Think about existing tower. 6)
Rationale for grassland site? Answer: To understand what happened across
Singapore, we need to understand different ecosystems. - Can never set a
permanent site in grassland

2024/11/23 Notes About Soil Respiration

Soil Respiration components: root respiration, surface-litter
respiration and the respiration of soil organic matter (including root
detritus)

-   Lowest soil respiration occur in coldest (tundra & northern bogs)
    and driest (deserts) biomes, highest in tropical moist forests where
    both T and moisture availability are high year-round

    -   Soil respiration rates in northern peatlands were shown to be
        positively correlated with depth to water table by Moore and
        Knowles (1989) and Luken and Billings (1985)

-   Soil respiration rates are positively correlated with mean annual
    air T and mean annual precipitation

For soil respiration studies Q10 values cited range from 1.3 to 3.3
(Reich & Schlesinger 1992). Based on a review of in situ measurements,
the Q10 value for total soil respiration has a median value of 2.4.

The **turnover time** of soil carbon refers to the average time that
carbon remains in the soil before being released back into the
atmosphere as carbon dioxide through decomposition. = soil carbon pool /
soil respiration rate from the decomposition of soil organic matter (if
with assumption live root contribute 30%, then you get soil R \* 0.70
for soil organic matter decomposition)

Discussion: Ecosystem respiration, collar heights

03/24 Questions?
Why not using nighttime for night data and daytime for day data to solve the light inhibition problem?


Should we consider this in our research?

Why do you think daytime partitioning method is better than nighttime? Uncertainty is larger?

A scan on CUE related papers and found researchers has been mostly thinking CUE as constant over the last 20 years, too difficult to get the measurements of Ra and NPP. There's no investigation on CUE for variations across ecosystems and across seasons.
